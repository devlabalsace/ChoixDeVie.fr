# Web site for ChoixDeVie.fr
Created with Orchard Core (Asp.Net Core 3.1)

This web site, on its first version, is based on the [Orchard Core CMS](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore).
Orchard Core is a very good modern CMS, with some very useful features, like the [workflows](https://docs.orchardcore.net/en/dev/docs/reference/modules/Workflows).
